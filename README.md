# 🎓 Student Performance Dashboard - [POWER-BI]

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes student marks, grades, and results across subjects. Built for the **MS Elevate Internship Capstone**, it provides interactive insights into academic performance using slicers, charts, and conditional formatting.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Educational institutions often lack a consolidated, visual system to analyze student performance across subjects and grades. Manual tracking is inefficient and fails to highlight trends, top performers, or pass/fail ratios effectively.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
An interactive Power BI dashboard that:
- Visualizes student marks and result distribution
- Highlights top scorer and subject-wise averages
- Enables filtering by subject, grade, and result
- Applies conditional formatting for clarity
