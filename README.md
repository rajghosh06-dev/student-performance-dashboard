# 🎓 Student Performance Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes student marks, grades, and results across subjects. Built for the **MS Elevate Internship Capstone**, it provides interactive insights into academic performance using slicers, charts, and conditional formatting.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Educational institutions often lack a consolidated, visual system to analyze student performance across subjects and grades. Manual tracking is inefficient and fails to highlight trends, top performers, or pass/fail ratios effectively.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
An interactive Power BI dashboard that:
- Visualizes student marks and result distribution
- Highlights top scorer and subject-wise averages
- Enables filtering by subject, grade, and result
- Applies conditional formatting for clarity

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Power BI Desktop**  
- **Excel** (data source)  
- **DAX** (for calculated measures and formatting)

---

## Key Features
-  Total Students: `50`  
-  Average Marks: `67.38`  
-  Pass Percentage: `80%`  
-  Top Scorer: `Harsha` (95 marks)  
-  Subject-wise averages (bar chart)  
-  Pass vs Fail distribution (pie chart)  
-  Slicers for Subject, Grade, and Result  
-  Conditional formatting on Result and Grade columns  
-  Table view with scroll note: *“Showing top 8 of 50 records. Full dataset available in submission file.”*
